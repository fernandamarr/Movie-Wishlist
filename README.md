# Movie Wishlist
------
A dynamic web app for users to search for movies, see what's trending, check out what other users are interested in, and add their favorites to a Wish List. 
  
## General info
------
This project was inspired by our love for movie nights. We wanted to create a website to search for movies, watch trailers, and find additional information by using the IMDb API. Additionally, we used Local Storage so users can save the movies they would like to see in the future in their Wishlist. To make it interactive with other users, we used Firebase to pull the movies placed in other users Wish List and display them on the page.
